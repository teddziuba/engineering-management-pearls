# Engineering Management Pearls
Points of wisdom, learned the hard way.

## Managing People
ðŸ¦ª **A 1:1 has a 10-minute decompression zone.**

The first ten minutes of a weekly 1:1 meeting should be spent building rapport. Ask your direct report about something in their personal life, and just let them talk. After that, they will be warm enough to get into a more honest conversation about work.

ðŸ¦ª **Stay for at most two drinks, then leave.**

When going out to a bar with your team, stay for one drink, two at most, then leave. No matter how good a rapport you have with your direct reports, they need time together without the boss around.

ðŸ¦ª **When there is always an excuse, there is always a problem.**

An IC who always has an empathy-provoking excuse about why they are not meeting their goals is simply an under-performer. If it happens once, that's just life. Twice is a string of bad luck. Three times is not a coincidence.

ðŸ¦ª **You will never regret firing somebody too soon.**

Firing people sucks. It is one of the worst parts of being a manager, unless you're a psychopath. When you start thinking that someone is underperforming, start gathering the evidence. The longer you keep them around out of guilt or uncertainty, the longer the rest of the team learns that this is an acceptable standard.

## Developing Software
ðŸ¦ª **`(number_of_subtasks + 1)` is a strikigly effective method of estimating story points.**

For a junior team, or a team that is just getting started with an Agile-like methodology, this helps them learn to break down stories into manageable chunks, and the pointing falls out of the decomposition exercise. It will get you off the ground quickly.

ðŸ¦ª **Just use Jira.**

Jira is one of many pieces of software that tries to be everything to everyone, but one of the few that actually succeeds at it. Engineers all know it. They are comfortable with its warts. Other task trackers aren't worth the trouble.

ðŸ¦ª **If your team doesn't have enough to do, you have weak product management.**

You should have a 1-year roadmap that you can explain in 30 seconds. If your team is looking for projects to fill their quarterly dance card, then the product managers that support you are not feeding you.
