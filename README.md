# Engineering Management Pearls
Points of wisdom, learned the hard way.

## Managing People
ðŸ¦ª **A 1:1 has a 10-minute decompression zone.**

The first ten minutes of a weekly 1:1 meeting should be spent building rapport. Ask your direct report about something in their personal life, and just let them talk. After that, they will be warm enough to get into a more honest conversation about work.

ðŸ¦ª **Stay for at most two drinks, then leave.**

When going out to a bar with your team, stay for one drink, two at most, then leave. No matter how good a rapport you have with your direct reports, they need time together without the boss around.

ðŸ¦ª **Don't drink alcohol with co-workers.**

You need to be completely above reproach as a people manager. Stay sober and keep your wits about you when in the company of the company. This is not contradictory to the previous pearl: when you are out drinking with co-workers, order a club soda with lime. It looks like a vodka tonic, and nobody will be any the wiser.

ðŸ¦ª **When there is always an excuse, there is always a problem.**

An IC who always has an empathy-provoking excuse about why they are not meeting their goals is simply an under-performer. If it happens once, that's just life. Twice is a string of bad luck. Three times is not a coincidence.

ðŸ¦ª **You will never regret firing somebody too soon.**

Firing people sucks. It is one of the worst parts of being a manager, unless you're a psychopath. When you start thinking that someone is underperforming, start gathering the evidence. The longer you keep them around out of guilt or uncertainty, the longer the rest of the team learns that this is an acceptable standard.

ðŸ¦ª **Always try to make your manager look good.**

This doesn't mean singing their praises, it means delivering on your own without their intervention. Find out what success looks like for your manager, then work toward that. It will be easier to get the resources you need.

ðŸ¦ª **Your team is high-performing if it is constantly expanding its scope.**

To expand its scope, your team needs strong technical skills _and_ strong internal leaders. If you are developing both of these, then your team is in the top 10% of performance.

ðŸ¦ª **Present a high-quality quarterly kickoff deck, every single quarter.**

The information you convey in this deck is important, but not as important as the effort you put into making it look good. This shows your team that you care about what they are doing enough to spend the time to present it cleanly.

ðŸ¦ª **People will support you if they don't like you, but they'll never support you if they think you don't like them.**

You can't control whether or not people like you, but you can control your outward opinion of others. When someone believes _you_ dislike _them_, they will avoid you, for fear that you will use any influence you have to harm them.

## Developing Software
ðŸ¦ª **`(number_of_subtasks + 1)` is a strikigly effective method of estimating story points.**

For a junior team, or a team that is just getting started with an Agile-like methodology, this helps them learn to break down stories into manageable chunks, and the pointing falls out of the decomposition exercise. It will get you off the ground quickly.

ðŸ¦ª **Jira always wins.**

Jira is one of many pieces of software that tries to be everything to everyone, but one of the few that actually succeeds at it. Engineers all know it. They are comfortable with its warts. Other task trackers aren't worth the trouble.

ðŸ¦ª **If your team doesn't have enough to do, you have weak product management.**

You should be able to explain what your team is doing for the next year in 30 seconds. If your team is looking for projects to fill their quarterly dance card, then the product managers that support you are not feeding you.

## Hiring
ðŸ¦ª **When interviewing other managers, look for situations that don't work out cleanly.**

A weak manager will not admit to you that they "failed". A strong manager will tell you what they learned. My favorite question for this is: _"Tell me about a time that you performance-managed an IC"_. Weak managers will tell you about an IC recovering after a PIP or coaching. Strong managers will tell you about someone they fired, and how they made the call. This profession is all about solving problems that don't have great solutions, so look for managers who understand that.
